                    <string key="text">Solitaire uses a standard 52 card deck of playing cards without jokers.
The objective of the game is to expose all cards and move them into the foundation piles. There are 4 foundation piles (one for each suit) that are represented on the screen by the A with a rectangle drawn around it. These piles are built upward in suit from Aces to Kings.
There are 7 tableau columns that are built downward (in decreasing rank, from Kings to Aces) in alternating colors(red, black). Partial or complete piles can be moved from one column to another if they are built down by alternate colors and decreasing rank. Any empty column can only be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King at the top.
There is 1 stock pile. The stock pile contains cards that have not yet been moved to a foundation pile or a tableau column. You can go through the stock pile as many times as you want turning over either 1 or 3 cards at a time depending on the setting of the Draw 3 option. Tap the empty stock pile to run through the stock pile a second time and subsequent times.
When cards are turned over from the stock pile they go into the waste pile, you can move the top card from the waste pile to any legal location in the foundation piles or tableau columns.
Cards can be moved by dragging and dropping a single card or a group of cards. Cards can be dragged from the waste pile, foundation piles and tableau columns. Cards can be dropped on the tableau columns and the foundation piles. A single tap on the stock pile will turn over either 1 or 3 cards (depending on the option setting) onto the waste pile. A single tap on a card in the tableau column will put it on the possilbe position, the foundation is optimal.
Not all games have a solution, a draw 1 card game is easier to win than draw 3 card game.

The x multiplier:
The x multplier (e.g.x88) is visible at the bottom of the screen.The x multplier decreases in Time.it is used to compute the points assigned to any move.The higher the multiplier the more points can be received with that move.In other words,the moves at the beginning of A game receive more points than the ones at the end.

Scoring:
Each new game starts off at 0 points. Each card that is moving to the foundation from the tableau column receives 15 points. Each card that is moving to the foundation from the waste pile receives 10 points. Each card that is moved to a tableau column from the waste pile receives 5 points. Each card that is turned over in the tableau column receives 5 points. When a card is moved to the tableau column from the foundation piles there is a loss of 15 points.  When the Draw 3 option is on there is a loss of 20 points for each pass through the stock pile after the 3rd time. When the Draw 3 option is off there is a loss of 100 points for each pass through the stock pile. </string>
